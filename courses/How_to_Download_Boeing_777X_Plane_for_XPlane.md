There are several options for downloading Boeing 777X plane for X-Plane, depending on your preferences and budget. Here are some of them:
 
- **Boeing 777 Worldliner Pro- Extended Pack**: This is a premium add-on that includes four versions of the Boeing 777 Worldliner: the 777-200 LR, the 777-200 F (Cargo), the 777-300 ER, and the 777-200 ER. This add-on features a realistic flight model, a fully functional FMS, a custom designed navigation display, a comprehensive manual, and more. It costs $64.95 and you can get it from the X-Plane.Org Store[^1^].
- **777-9 N779XW**: This is a free add-on that converts an older version of the 777-9 to X-Plane 11. It has a better livery, a new fly by wire config, more cockpit functionality, and corrected light positions. It also has a lever to fold the wingtips. However, it does not have a 3D cockpit, so you might want to use a modified version of the default 777 cockpit made by @xpHolmes. You can download it from the X-Plane.Org Forum[^2^].
- **Air New Zealand Boeing 777-200ER**: This is another free add-on that features a B777-200ER in the livery of Air New Zealand. The aircraft ZK-OKC is painted in the new colors. It is compatible with X-Plane 10 and 11. You can download it from Fly Away Simulation[^3^].

Once you have downloaded your preferred add-on, you need to unzip it and copy the folder to your X-Plane/Aircraft directory. Then you can launch X-Plane and select the Boeing 777X plane from the aircraft menu. Enjoy flying the most advanced Boeing jet ever!

The Boeing 777X is the latest addition to the Boeing 777 family, which is one of the most popular and successful wide-body airliners in the world. The 777X was first announced in 2013 and is expected to enter service in 2023. The 777X has two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9. The 777-8 has a longer range but a smaller capacity, while the 777-9 has a shorter range but a larger capacity. Both variants have a wingspan of 71.8 meters (235 feet), but can fold their wingtips to 64.8 meters (212 feet) to fit into standard airport gates.
 
One of the most distinctive features of the 777X is its folding wingtips, which are designed to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. The wingtips can fold up or down in less than 20 seconds, and are locked in place during flight. The folding mechanism is powered by hydraulic actuators and controlled by the flight computer. The wingtips also have sensors and indicators to alert the pilots and ground crew of their position. The folding wingtips are the first of their kind to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for commercial use.
 
Another notable feature of the 777X is its larger windows, which are designed to enhance passenger comfort and visibility. The windows are 15% larger than those of the previous 777 models, and are placed higher on the fuselage. The windows also have electrochromic dimming, which allows passengers to adjust the brightness of the windows with a touch of a button. The windows are made of composite materials that are stronger and lighter than glass.
